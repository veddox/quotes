QUOTES README
=============

quotes is a small utility for creating, organizing and accessing your own
personal collection of quotes.

Written in line with the Unix philosophy, it is small, scriptable and concentrates
on doing its one thing well. Implemented in Common Lisp, it comes with a simple, 
text-based commandline interface.

Licensed under the terms of the MIT license.


INSTALLING

Currently the only supported Common Lisp implementation is clisp. If have not
installed this yet, you will most likely find it in your distribution's repository.
On Ubuntu and derivatives, you can get it by passing the following command:

	sudo apt-get install clisp

Once clisp is installed, navigate to the directory containing quotes and start it
with:

	./quotes.lisp

If you plan on using it regularly, you can do the following for easy access
(requires root, assumes you are in the quotes folder):
	
	mkdir /usr/lib/quotes
	cp quotes.lisp util.lisp parser.lisp backend.lisp /usr/lib/quotes
	chmod 755 /usr/lib/quotes/*.lisp
	ln -s /usr/lib/quotes/quotes.lisp /usr/bin/quotes

From now on, you can access quotes like any other command in terminal.


USING

For a summary of commandline options, type

	quotes --help

Starting quotes without any parameters launches the interactive mode, which is
self-explanatory.

The default quote collection set up by quotes lives at ~/.quotes. This is a plain 
text file with a very simple syntax that is easy to expand and edit by hand - 
feel free!


TODO

Make the installation process file more user-friendly. Add support for other
Common Lisp implementations (especially SBCL). Fix bugs.

Long-term: write a GUI. This probably ought to be a standalone application in
its own right, which could communicate with quotes using sockets - that means
that quotes would need a server mode to be able to keep running in the background.
